Smart Attendance Tracker employs python libraries to recognise the face.<br>
When we run the python code,it asks for the subject that you as a teacher is teaching, depending on whether you are using personal camera or USB portal, you can use 0/1 in "video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(0)" respectively.
<br>It then recognises the students present in your database and marks it as 1 incase they are present in the respective column of date.
<br> On running this code, you can type "Entrepeneurship" when it asks for input class name. To create your own subject, you can create a sheet in "Teacher.xlsx" with subject name and students taking the course.
